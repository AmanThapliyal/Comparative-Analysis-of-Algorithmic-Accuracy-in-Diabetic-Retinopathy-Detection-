1. Overall Accuracy:  
o Random Forest has the highest accuracy (93%), followed by SVM (86%) and 
CNN (70%).  
2. Performance on NO DR Cases:  
o Random Forest performs the best, followed by SVM. CNN has moderate 
performance in this category.  
3. Performance on Mild & Moderate Cases:  
o SVM and Random Forest show balanced performance, while CNN struggles 
with inconsistent results.  
4. Recall for Proliferative and Severe Cases:  
o Random Forest significantly outperforms the other two models in recall for 
both proliferative (0.75) and severe (0.64) cases.  
o SVM performs moderately, while CNN has low recall in these categories 
(Proliferative: 0.26, Severe: 0.16).  
5. Key Strengths:  
o SVM: Excels in "NO DR" classification and has robustness in simpler tasks.  
o Random Forest: Handles data variability effectively, making it the most 
balanced and accurate model overall.  
o CNN: Has potential for advanced feature learning due to its deep learning 
architecture.  
6. Key Challenges:  
o SVM: Overlap in advanced stages reduces its effectiveness for complex cases. 
o  
robust.  
Random Forest: Struggles with severe cases, despite generally being 
o CNN: Requires extensive data and careful tuning to improve performance, 
particularly for severe cases.  
General Conclusion:  
• Random Forest appears to be the most suitable model overall, due to its superior 
accuracy and balanced performance across categories.  
• SVM is reliable for simpler classification tasks but struggles in complex cases.  
• CNN may require more data, fine-tuning, and improvements to address its current 
limitations and realize its potential for feature learning.
