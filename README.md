# Comparative-Analysis-of-Algorithmic-Accuracy-in-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-
Develop a robust and reliable model for the detection and classification of Diabetic   Retinopathy (DR) into five distinct categories: No Diabetic Retinopathy (NO DR), Mild,  Moderate, Proliferative, and Severe. The objective is to support early diagnosis and improve  clinical decision-making by automating the analysis of retinal images.  
evaluates the performance of three distinct algorithmsâ€”Support Vector  
Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) combined with SVM or Random Forest (RF). Each model is analyzed for its overall 
accuracy, class-specific metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score), and ability to address challenges 
such as class imbalance and feature overlap.
