# Comparative-Analysis-of-Algorithmic-Accuracy-in-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-
Develop a robust and reliable model for the detection and classification of Diabetic   Retinopathy (DR) into five distinct categories: No Diabetic Retinopathy (NO DR), Mild,  Moderate, Proliferative, and Severe. The objective is to support early diagnosis and improve  clinical decision-making by automating the analysis of retinal images.  
evaluates the performance of three distinct algorithms—Support Vector  
Machines (SVM), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Principal Component Analysis 
(PCA) combined with SVM or Random Forest (RF). Each model is analyzed for its overall 
accuracy, class-specific metrics (Precision, Recall, F1-score), and ability to address challenges 
such as class imbalance and feature overlap.

Data Acquisition  
• Datasets:  
To train and evaluate the models, we will use publicly available datasets that are 
widely used in Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) research. The primary datasets include:   
o Kaggle’s Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset: A large dataset containing 
thousands of retinal images annotated with DR severity labels.  
o EyePACS: Another prominent dataset consisting of retinal fundus images with 
corresponding DR severity labels.  
These datasets are chosen because they contain diverse sets of images that represent 
different stages of DR and provide a large number of samples for training and testing the 
models. The labels in the datasets are categorized into five severity levels based on the 
extent of Diabetic Retinopathy, which are as follows:  
• No Diabetic Retinopathy (No DR)  
• Mild Diabetic Retinopathy (Mild)  
• Moderate Diabetic Retinopathy (Moderate)  
• Severe Diabetic Retinopathy (Severe)  
• Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (Proliferative)  
These severity levels allow the models to learn and differentiate between subtle and severe 
changes in the retina, helping to identify not only the presence of DR but also its progression.
